# CardGame
This game is Go Fish. It is a two person game and when the game starts each person will be prompted for their name. Then the players should decide how many rounds 
they want to play. Player 1 will go first. Player1's cards will be displayed on the screen. The goal of the game is to make as many pairs as possible, so player1 
will look at their cards and ask player2 for a card that would allow them to make a pair. If they made a pair, PAIR will show up on the screen and player1 gets to 
go again. If they don't, GO FISH and it is player2's turn. If someone makes a pair, that counts as one point. This repeats for the number of rounds played. At the 
end of the game (after the number of rounds is complete or someone runs out of cards) the winner will show.
